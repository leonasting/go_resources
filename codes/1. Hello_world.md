go mod init example/hello
Command to create and enter the folder
```
mkdir hello
cd hello
```

Enable dependency tracking for your code.
```
$ go mod init example/hello
#go: creating new go.mod: module example/hello


```

When your code imports packages contained in other modules, you manage those dependencies through your code's own module. 
That module is defined by a go.mod file that tracks the modules that provide those packages. That go.mod file stays with your code, including in your source code repository

To fetch pacakage and installing it

```
go mod tidy
```

``` go
// a main package (a package is a way to group functions, and it's made up of all the files in the same directory).
package main
//Import the popular fmt package, which contains functions for formatting text, including printing to the console.
// This package is one of the standard library packages you got when you installed Go.
import "fmt"
//Implement a main function to print a message to the console. A main function executes by default when you run the main package.
func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```
