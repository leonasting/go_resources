In **Go**, the `panic` function serves a crucial role in handling exceptional situations. Letâ€™s delve into its purpose and usage:

1. **What is `panic`?**
    
    - `panic` is a **built-in function** that disrupts the normal flow of a program.
    - When a function encounters a panic, it **abruptly halts execution**, executes any deferred functions, and then returns to its caller.
    - [If the panic propagates up the call stack and reaches the top of a goroutineâ€™s stack, the entire program terminates with an error message](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28472922/when-to-use-os-exit-and-panic)[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28472922/when-to-use-os-exit-and-panic)[2](https://marketsplash.com/tutorials/go/golang-panic/).
2. **When to Use `panic`?**
    
    - **Unrecoverable State**: `panic` is employed when a program or a specific part of it reaches an **unrecoverable state**.
    - **Runtime Errors**: It is also triggered implicitly for **run-time errors**, such as:
        - Indexing a slice out of bounds.
        - Failing a type assertion.
    - **Deferred Functions**: When a panic occurs, any **deferred functions** are executed before unwinding the stack.
    - **Avoiding `panic`**:
        - In most cases, itâ€™s better to **return an error** instead of using `panic`.
        - Reserve `panic` for **special situations** where recovery is impossible or unnecessary.
        - [**Rarely use `os.Exit`** outside of tests or quick program termination](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28472922/when-to-use-os-exit-and-panic)[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28472922/when-to-use-os-exit-and-panic).
3. **Example Scenarios**:
    
    - **Use `panic`**:
        - When you need to execute a **deferred function** (since `os.Exit` wonâ€™t execute deferred functions).
    - **Use `os.Exit`**:
        - To **abort the program immediately** without deferred cleanup.
        - To return an **error code** for other programs to report what happened.

Remember, while `panic` can be powerful, it should be used judiciously. Strive for clean error handling and avoid unnecessary panic in your Go code! ðŸš€
